# Sorting Algorithm Performance Analysis

## Description
This program implements three sorting algorithms: quicksort, bubble sort, and a hybrid method combining quicksort and bubble sort. The hybrid algorithm is used to test different k values, aiming to find the most optimal k value for sorting. The program also generates a graphical representation of the relationship between execution time and different k values, providing a visual insight into the optimal parameter choice.

## Source Files
- **main.py**: The main program file orchestrating the sorting algorithms and performance analysis.
- **sort.py**: Contains the implementations of quicksort, bubble sort, and the hybrid sorting algorithm.
- **rand10000.txt**: Input data file with 10,000 randomly generated elements.
- **rand1000000.txt**: Input data file with 1,000,000 randomly generated elements.

## Program Output
The program output includes the execution time for various k values. Here's a snippet of the output:

## How to Run
1. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
2. Run `main.py` to execute the program.

## Dependencies
- Python 3.x

## Notes
- The input data files (`rand10000.txt` and `rand1000000.txt`) contain randomly generated elements for testing the sorting algorithms.
